# RussBus Movie App

For the Thinkful React-Capstone project curriculum.

## Getting started

### Setting up a project

### Movie App

* This is a simple Movie rating app using React. You can search for movies which are pulled from a movie database API,
* then rate it based on violence, language and sensuality (I may add or alter these topics later). Based on your review,
* you'll be told how your rating stacks up with the movie's actual rating.
